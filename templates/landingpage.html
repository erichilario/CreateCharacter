		<h4>Summary</h4>
		<p>This project was created by <span class="ylw">Eric Hilario (s121102) for HIT237 - Building Interactive Software in Semester 1 of 2019</span> in fulfilment of Assignment 2 Task 1. Task 2 Documentation is built-in to the website - under <a class="alink" href="{% url 'data-model' %}">data-model</a>, <a class="alink" href="{% url 'data-dictionary' %}">data-dictionary</a> and <a class="alink" href="{% url 'user-guide' %}">user-guide</a>. These are jointly <a class="alink" href="https://erichilario.pythonanywhere.com/static/HILARIO, Eric 121102 - HIT237 Assignment 2 Task 2.pdf">available as a PDF</a>. This project is currently hosted and can be viewed in <a class="alink" href="https://erichilario.pythonanywhere.com">https://erichilario.pythonanywhere.com</a> as proof of concept, while the code is maintained in <a class="alink" href="https://github.com/erichilario/createcharacter">https://github.com/erichilario/createcharacter</a>.</p>
		<p>The <span class="ylw">task</span> was to build an interactive database-driven website using Django forms to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality for the records in the database. The <span class="ylw">idea</span> was to create a "Character Creation" screen for a fictional web-based MMORPG. The characters created by the user are displayed in the character selection screen where the combination of attributes represent a specific image. The <span class="ylw">attributes</span> (or the database tables Race, Job, Color, Hair, Face, Sex) all help in describing the character that a user might want to create. Clicking on a character will allow for editing its name and attributes as well as deleting it entirely. Every change to the attribute will also change the character's represenation/avatar to reflect the changes. Models, graphics, fonts, styling and various other imagery were heavily inspired by and based on the popular MMORPG World of Warcraft (specifically patch 2.4.3).</p>

		<h4>Requirements</h4>
		<p>The scope of this topic allowed for meeting the minimum data complexity requirement of 2 additional tables associated with the principal topic. Django's built-in User model was also utilised. Django v1.11.2 and Python 3.6.4 were used in creating this project. Among the requirements met were persistent navigation options, logical links to the detail page of each record as well as buttons within the various forms to create, edit and delete a record. SQLite3 baked into Django was the natural database of choice. There are forms to create and edit the characters that accept user input which in turn, makes changes to the database and automagically updates the graphical representation of the character. Deletion of a record asks for confirmation. Hyperlinks all use the &#123;&#37;url&#37;&#125; tag. Temporary accounts are provided to be able view the records of the pre-populated database without signing up although signing up works just as well. Documentation requirements are in the navigation links above and also in PDF form.
